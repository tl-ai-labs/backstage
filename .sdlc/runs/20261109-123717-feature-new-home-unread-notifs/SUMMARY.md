Status: **accepted**

Written by code from this run's records (manifest.json and the files below); every figure is the manifest's.

## Cost

| | Cost |
|---|---:|
| Dispatched work (the calls the dispatch server made or logged) | $0.5983 |
| Orchestrator overhead (this session's own loop, priced from its transcripts) | $32.3970 |
| In-session work already inside the overhead, counted once | −$0.1920 |
| **True total** | **$32.8032** |

How the overhead was measured: transcript (no receipt; unverified).

### By phase

The calls dispatched (or logged) in each phase. The rest of the orchestrator's own loop is in the overhead above, in no phase.

|---|---:|---|---:|
| preflight | 4 | claude-opus-5-5, gemini-3.8-flash | $0.0041 |
| requirements_analysis | 3 | claude-opus-5-5 | $0.1920 |
| plan_task_packets | 1 | none | $0.0000 |
| codegen | 12 | gemini-3.8-flash, claude-opus-5-5 | $0.1430 |
| docs | 4 | gemini-3.8-flash | $0.0178 |
| tests | 5 | gemini-3.8-flash | $0.0506 |
| debug | 10 | gemini-3.8-flash, claude-opus-5-5 | $0.1907 |
| security_review (measured: the helper's own transcript) | 7 | claude-opus-5-5 | $0.3904 |
| architecture_design (measured: the helper's own transcript) | 104 | claude-opus-5-5 | $17.2620 |
| senior_code_review (measured: the helper's own transcript) | 6 | claude-opus-5-5 | $0.5125 |

A phase marked measured ran in a helper of this session (the architect or a reviewer): its cost is that helper's transcript priced at the list (part of the overhead above), in place of any estimate the orchestrator logged.

### Dispatched work by model

| Model | Calls | Cost |
|---|---:|---:|
| claude-opus-5-5 | 6 | $0.3902 |
| gemini-3.8-flash | 32 | $0.2080 |
| none | 1 | $0.0000 |

### Orchestrator overhead by model

| Model | Role | Messages | Cost |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| claude-opus-5-5 | session | 100 | $7.3707 |
| claude-opus-5-5 | helper | 255 | $25.0263 |

## Provisional — re-run after closing this session

The collector reads the session's transcripts; run from inside a session that has not ended, it misses the session's own tail. Once the session is closed, run:

```
node "/Users/macbook/.claude/plugins/cache/tilicho-ai-labs/mmo/0.10.1/scripts/collect-orchestrator-usage.mjs" "/Users/macbook/Documents/GitHub/Google-Projects/bf-agy/BS-NF-09/.sdlc/runs/20261109-123717-feature-new-home-unread-notifs" --project-root "/Users/macbook/Documents/GitHub/Google-Projects/bf-agy/BS-NF-09"
